# Malaria-Bounding-Box-
Given the image data which contains cells of 6 different classes of which 2 classes are of uninfected cells and 4 classes of infected cells. We have to build a model which can localize each object cells in an image with bounding box and detect the class cordinates of cells with high confidence score and with high mean average precision. This case study has been done using yolov3 algorithm.
